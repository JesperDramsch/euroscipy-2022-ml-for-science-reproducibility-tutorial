# Model Sharing Resources


Currently sources of randomness are documented in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html) and [Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/faq/#how-can-i-obtain-reproducible-results-using-keras-during-development).

The resource [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/code-quality.html) further goes into detail on code quality and good data practices for reproducible research {cite:p}`turingway`.
