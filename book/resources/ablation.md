# Ablation Study Resources

Normally, [ablation studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_(artificial_intelligence)) are performed on neural networks that are much more complex than the simple example in the notebook. 

A first application was done on artificial neural networks in analogy to neurosurgery {cite:p}`ablation`.

For example, Deepmind have been early adopters of thorough ablation studies in their papers {cite:p}`Hessel2018`.
