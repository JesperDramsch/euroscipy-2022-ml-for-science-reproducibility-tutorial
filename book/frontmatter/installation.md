## Installation

Both `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` are provided to install packages.

### Avoid installation

You can run these notebooks in cloud computing. This button to binder will automagically install the dependencies for you and let you explore online!

Simply launch Binder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JesperDramsch/ml-for-science-reproducibility-tutorial/HEAD

In addition, every notebook below also has a link to Colab, Paperspace Gradient, and AWS Studio that can run your notebooks in the cloud. These might not have the requirements installed (but honestly they often have the standard ML stack, so you should be good.)

### Using PIP

You can install the packages using `pip`:

```
$ pip install -r requirements/tutorial.txt
```
