    "# Model Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Some journals will require the sharing of code or models, but even if they donâ€™t we might benefit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime we share a model, we give other researchers the opportunity to replicate our studies and iterate upon them. Altruistically, this advances science, which in and of itself is a noble pursuit. However, this also increases the citations of our original research, a core metric for most researchers in academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore how we can export models and make our training codes reproducible. Saving a model from scikit-learn is easy enough. But what tools can we use to easily make our training code adaptable for others to import and try out that model? Specifically, I want to talk about:\n",
