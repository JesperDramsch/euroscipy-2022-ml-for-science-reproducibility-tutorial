# # Benchmarking
#
# Another common reason for rejections of machine learning papers in applied science is the lack of proper benchmarks. This section will be fairly short, as it differs from discipline to discipline.
#
# However, any time we apply a superfancy deep neural network, we need to supply a benchmark to compare the relative performance of our model to. These models should be established methods in the field and simpler machine learning methods like a linear model, support-vector machine or a random forest.
