# # Testing
#
# Machine learning is very hard to test. Due to the nature of the our models, we often have soft failures in the model that are difficult to test against.
#
# Writing software tests in science, is already incredibly hard, so in this section weâ€™ll touch on 
#
# - some fairly simple tests we can implement to ensure consistency of our input data
# - avoid bad bugs in data loading procedures
# - some strategies to probe our models
